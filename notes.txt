   a brief description, and links to "read more" pages for each project
   -- some can link to different websites (like playlist brew or
      bs-engineering where there is something to buy)
   -- others can link to "blog" posts on main site that give estimated

   -- printable pdf "overview" page for this would be nice too
   -- one project can be old Rose projects lumped in git repo
-- latex math can be done in markdown (don't need .tex or overleaf)

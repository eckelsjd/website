I still like the gantry system idea, but it does make it hard to access the pieces. It's also way too big for the average child (or adult for that matter -- but you should've seen the first version of this bot, which had to be disassembled to even take it out of the room it was built in ). So perhaps we shrink the size and simplify the number of moving components. </p> <p>I also like the spiral arm gripper, but it's not very consistent. Maybe need to replace the claw design with an easier magnetic-based design.

Hall thrusters have exploded in popularity in recent years due to their high efficiency and low cost. One of the primary challenges in Hall thruster development is accurately modeling the discharge plasma, especially with respect to the poorly understood physics of electron transport and the coupling of the thruster to its testing environment. These and other related issues introduce large uncertainties to model predictions and prevent the applicability of ground-test data to in-space operation. The ongoing work of the JANUS institute is to develop a predictive model of the Hall thruster operating in a vacuum chamber and to reliably make confidence-bounded estimates of in-space performance.</p> <p></p> <p>Fig 1.
